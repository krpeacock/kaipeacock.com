Today is the transgender day of visibility. "Happy trans day of visibility! My Dad wished me this morning. I appreciate that sentiment from him. His support means a lot to me, especially these days. I think I've cried while talking with him more times in the past couple of years than I did for decades prior. Transition is always a vulnerable thing to go through, especially in public. Disapproval of friends, family, the church that raised me, were always fears I had to face. Also a certain degree of physical danger - even as a white woman, transgender women face higher threats of violence than cis women, and of course far less than men. But of course those were table stakes in making my choice to transition. I'd make that choice again any day. However, the danger we're facing now is heartbreaking.

I flew for the first time since the Trump regime took over. I was afraid. Even though there are no reports of trans people being detained at airports yet, I'm still thinking ahead to what's coming. So far the administration has been kidnapping pro-Palestine protestors and organizers. They are particularly targeting students and immigrants, and are disregarding all forms of immigration law to do so. I'm not so naive as to believe that I still have rights as a US citizen. We're well beyond that point now when they can "revoke" someone's green card in the name of homeland security. So, even though today I can still travel domestically, I don't know how much longer that will be true.

How long do I wait? When is it time to flee? Is it the first time that a trans activist gets kidnapped and disappeared by masked thugs? Is it the second? Is it when they stop allowing people with X gender markers to re-enter the country? Is it when Texas starts to jail trans people for having "falsified documents" of their name and gender change? There are a million red lines that we may cross in the coming days and years. Is it actually possible to survive what's coming?
