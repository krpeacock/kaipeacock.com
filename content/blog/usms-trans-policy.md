On Monday, June 16th, 2025, US Masters Swimming (USMS) released a new interim policy announcing that trans women are not allowed to participate in "Rewards Programs". 

I feel like I should have some kind of well-thought-out statement, because I've written on the subject. It affects me. I don't know if I'm eligible to have my times recorded of if I have to compete as a man forever. I don't know and it doesn't matter.

These people want me dead. They're going to win in every capacity. The supreme court is on their side. Public opinion is against us. Someday, in one way or another, they're going to wind me down and kill me. Who even cares anymore. Whether it's through random violence in the streets, whether a brownshirt takes me to the camps, or whether they take away every good and normal thing that makes it possible to endure this godforsaken world, they are going to win. Congratulations. I hope your christly kingdom or your divine truth about biology or whatever is worth it.
