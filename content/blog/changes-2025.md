It's been a year since the 2024 elections. That was a time of terror for me, at a point where I was a little more than one year into my transition. When America decided to vote for Tr*\mp, I knew that very little in my life could continue as it had been, and I wasn't wrong. Shortly after the election, I set a few things in motion right away. I started the process of legally changing my name. Up until that point, I had been going by Kai, and identifying primarily as nonbinary. Partially out of defiance, but primarily through the clarity that comes in a moment of crisis, I decided that I wanted to identify as a woman, and so I chose the name Kaia, which is a feminine form of the name Kai in both English and German. I was able to change my name with the US government before Tr\*mp took office, came out at work, and then I braced for what was to come.

From a policy perspective, things have both happened faster and slower than I expected. The immediate executive orders and the start of the legal war was predictable. The anti-trans passport rules (which the Supreme Court recently voted in favor of) are terrifying. Tech companies, universities, and the media are largely bowing to pressure to ban us from restrooms, sports, and any positive coverage.

It's scary to see rights that I had a year ago get stripped away. Some of which I never even was able to access because I wasn't ready in time. I grieve that loss of freedom, but there's so much more we have to lose. I'm still expecting the day when the secret police are sent to kidnap us from our homes, forcing us into labor, torture, and eventually death. That is where this path has already taken us, when it comes to my immigrant neighbors, here in my hometown. It's impossible to pretend that my citizenship or whiteness will be any protection when the orders come down. But resistance calls for throwing a wrench in the works of fascism wherever possible. It looks like speaking up, and taking action to ensure that as many people survive the current moment as we can.

Socially things are different, too. I've been diving deeper into the queer community here in the city. I feel like I know more people than I ever have before, and there are more people who I can reach out to, while we can share each other's distress. We're all suffering more than usual these days. So many of my trans friends have lost jobs. I lost my own job at the Dfinity Foundation in July. Surely much of it is due to the horrible economy that effects us all, but layoffs seem to hit my trans friends pretty consistently. I'm constantly sharing and contributing to mutual aid requests of people who need help with rent, medical expenses, and the costs to flee their home state or even the country. Unfortunately that's what it takes for us to survive the current moment. We deserve better. We deserve to thrive.

It's also been a time where I'm starting to reconnect with people who I haven't interacted with in a while. I visited the church that raised me, on a whim. Their website still proudly says that the bible specifies there are "two distinct, complementary sexes", and that "rejection of one's biological sex is a rejection of god within that person". And of course, they believe that homosexuality is immoral, women can't preach, and so on. It's a place where I know that the vast majority of people voted for the man who promised, in accordance with those values, to strip me of my rights. It's a bizarre thing to step into a space like that as a trans woman. Some people recognized me. Most greeted me cordially. I was even told by the pastor that I was welcome to return, even though I patently was not. How could I be? Perhaps some imagined version of me that would "repent" and detransition for their approval could be welcome there. But the actual reality of me is a problem for their politics. The knowledge and lived experience I have about biological sex traits is a problem for their theology. But it's strange the way that at least in person, they see my reality and humanity. It's strange that they can't see that when they vote.

There are other people, though not many, who I've been able to havea chat with. People I knew growing up but haven't seen in years. An old friend, a former teacher. It's interesting, but not altogether unsurprising, that I can just sit down and have a normal conversation with people who knew me in such conservative contexts now without things being weird. It's probably a self-selection bias. The people who would have a hard time being normal with me probably just ignore me. But still, it's nice. It's also a salve against the fears I have about the world being turned against me. I can be prohibited from competing as a swimmer. My husband can get disowned by his parents. There are absolutely hateful people and real consequences of their hatred. However, it's not everyone. In fact, the vast majority of people are just as disinterested in my life as they were before I came out. That gives me hope for the future, as long as I live to see it.

A couple other random updates at the end - after a strange summer of unemployment and job searching, I have accepted an offer to join Amplitude, a data analytics company here in San Francisco. I'm proud of my work at Dfinity, but I'm not going to lie - I'm happy to get out of the crypto industry.

Additionally, I went ahead with some cosmetic procedures I started planning on back in November 2024. Together, they're known as "facial feminization surgery" or ffs. Healing has gone well, but it takes months to a year for everything to fully settle in. It'll take some time for the true results to arrive, but I do look notably different now than I did a couple months ago. And if you haven't seen me in a couple years, I already was looking quite different then just from the effects of estrogen, hair removal, and growing my hair out. So, I expect I'm going to do a lot of reintroducing myself to people going forward.

It's been nice to be able to fully rest during this recovery, with neither pressure to work nor to job hunt. That said, I'm bored AF at this point, and I'm looking forward to whatever new "normal" I'll get to return to by starting a new job. Much love to my friends and family who've held me through a tumultuous year.
