It's inauguration day, January 20th, 2025. I know it's going to be bad. I've been preparing for how much this new administration was going to do to strip away my rights since election night. I've deleted every social media and news app off my phone to avoid getting exposed to coverage of the election. It's time to focus on taking care of myself and staying alive. It's time to be offline. So where do I go? I go to a safe space, Archimedes Banya.

Archimedes Banya has meant a lot to me. I have been a customer as long as I've lived in San Francisco. It is the only coed bathing / sauna that allows nudity in San Francisco, and I've enjoyed the casual culture of conversation, food, and relaxation there. My husband and I love it because it was the one spot we could attend together. As a T4T couple, we've been at the Banya at all stages of our lives together. Pre-transition, while identifying as non-binary, and now as more or less binary trans people. It was a safe (if pricey) place to be together, to go with friends, and to have an afternoon or evening to be in our bodies.

On election day, it had been a while since we last were at the Banya. Rhett had recovered from top surgery, and I've progressed a lot in my transition since the last time I went. When we first arrived, we learned that it was a children's day, so we went for a walk and came back a bit later. We showed our IDs, and the staff at the front asked which changing room we wanted to use. Rhett went to the men's and I went to the womens. It was a decidedly normal and affirming San Francisco experience, even if I had felt a little apprehensive about whether we might have a hard time.

The time there was pleasant. I changed in the women's locker room, and no one was phased to see a non-op trans woman. Rhett and I met back up in the main area, and enjoyed the baths and saunas. It was the same as any other time I'd been there. A mostly cis crowd, but if anything a slightly disproportionate number of trans people were enjoying the space, relative to the population of San Franisco. It's how it's always been at Banya in my experience. At one point I was foiled in my attempt to not learn about the election by a well-meaning cis ally who approached me and Rhett in the tubs, expressed solidarity, and asked how we felt about Trump railing against trans people in his speech. Oh well. I would learn about it anyway.

Why am I sharing this? Well you may or may not have seen news this week about protests against Archimedes Banya coming out of San Francisco right now. According to the wayback machine, as reported in [this article from the SF Examiner](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/the-city/archimedes-banya-spa-backlash-follows-gender-policy-changes/article_feda005e-f95a-11ef-8f1d-6be1172c14a6.html), a few days after my visit, the Banya management surreptitiously updated the pages for their longstanding women's and men's night monthly events. The new copy read "To further accommodate their religious beliefes we have to limit admission on Women's Day to **BIOLOGICAL WOMEN ONLY**" (emphasis was present in the original text).

Reporting on this has been mixed in its quality. The headline from the [SF Standard](https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/04/archimedes-banya-ladies-only-night-trans-women-excluded/) reads "SF bathhouse excludes trans women from new ladies-only night". This is an innacurate and I'd assume malicious framing. Trans women have always attended Women's night at Banya. My husband used to attend pre-transition and spoke of it fondly. It was a less crowded and quieter night to attend, and I'd been looking forward to attending at some point with friends. I've often recommended it to other trans women and nonbinary friends who were interested in having a bathing experience in the city but were uncomfortable and wanted to have a safe experience!

> Trans women have always attended Women's night at Banya.

No, this was not some new special terf night. They banned trans people quietly from the existing men's and women's nights, and have only begun to attempt to justify themselves after receiving pushback. Since they have only suggested adding a second "inclusive" women's night but not one for men, it's clear that this was always about trans women. Banya has only doubled down since then

![Banya's press statement: reads "March 3, 2025 Dear banya patrons: It has been a long and difficult night filled with reflection on how to best navigate the conversation unfolding around us. We are listening. We are reading the comments – some of them filled with thoughtful perspectives, others with painful accusations. And we want to take a moment co clarify our intentions. We have seen messages that cis women don't deserve space, that asking for a phallus-free environemnt is inherently hateful, and that any separation is an act of exclusion. That is categorically not true. The request for a phallic-free space is not about exclusion – it is about recognizing that some members of our community experience a different reaction to that part of the human body. Whether that reaction is based on personal history, trauma, cultural or religious beliefs, or simply comfort, it is valid. It should not be controversial to hold space for both needs and we are planning to arrange monthly: A night that welcomes all women, regardless of gender identity. A night that provides a healing, comfortable space for those who need a female-only phallus-free environment. Some have framed this as an issue of marginalization, but intention matters. Our intention has never been, and never will be, to push trans women away. Archimedes Banya has always been, and will always be, a place where trans women, trans men, and nonbinary individuals are welcome–every other day of the month"](banya-press-statement.png)

So, to be perfectly clear, they specifically trying to exclude the group of women who have external genitalia, on the premise of discomfort by a subset of the women who attend women's night. This "separate but equal" approach is not acceptable in San Francisco, and I am proud of everyone who is standing up against this. Businesses are feeling emboldened by the Trump administration to start discriminating against trans people. We cannot give an inch or they will take a mile. Fortunately we have laws against this type of discrimination, and I hope that San Francisco will do the right thing and enforce them. In the meantime, I will be boycotting Archimedes Banya, and I encourage you to join me and tell your friends. I'm not just disappointed, but also mad.
