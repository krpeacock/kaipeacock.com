the\nDFINITY Foundation, building developer tools for the Internet Computer Protocol. I identify as\ngenderqueer and use they/them pronouns, and am married to an awesome\npartner 🥰 who works for the city of SF.\nIn my spare time, I enjoy exploring Golden Gate Park, and I’ve volunteered\nas an educator for\nCode Tenderloin. I’ve\ncontributed to civic projects at\nCode for San Francisco,\nwhere I’ve built\n\nhttps://tenantprotections.org\n\nin collaboration with the Tech Equity Collaborative, in order to help\ntenants understand how California’s latest laws affect tenants. I also\nworked on a bike lane violation app at\napp.lanebreach.org and some\nsmall efforts for the\nOpen Transit project.\nI grew up in Walnut Creek and went to college in Illinois where I\nstudied Political Science and Philosophy. My partner and I met in Oxford\nwhile studying abroad, and we moved back to the bay area in 2015.\nAfter spending a semester studying Law at UC Davis, I dropped out to\nspend six months learning to code at\nGalvanize, a programming\nbootcamp.\nSince then, I worked at two marketing agencies,\nOrganic and\nAKQA, where I built pages for\n\nWells Fargo\n\nand Audi USA, where I\nre-skinned the My Audi experience. I spent a brief contract at\nSplunk before moving on to\nCuyana.\n\n  My Resume\n\n\n\n  Mastodon\n\nSo, what’s my deal?\nTo me, coding is a trade skill, and less of an identity. There are plenty of fun and interesting puzzles to solve in applying technology, but that’s always been less interesting to me than questions about how we relate to each other and what leads to human flourishing.\nTo that end, I’ve found that I keep coming back to a few things so far, as I’m building my career. The web is a fantastic tool for telling stories and connecting people, and it was well-designed to be accessible to people by default. As applications get more complicated, though, we tend to overlook and accidentally exclude people who access the web differently from how we do. That’s led me to listen and learn from experts on how to build things to always be accessible by default, and to keep listening as better approaches are introduced.\nI’ve also found that art and storytelling are intrinsically motivating to me. Equipping someone with the ability to bring their photography or copywriting to be shared with the world is always exciting. Music, art, and sharing information are all at the core of what I think can make the internet a beautiful place, and I was raised to be a guest who always tries to leave a place nicer than how I found it.\nback to home\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/","title":"About Kai"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":"Welcome to my blog!

My end goal is to build a handheld air quality meter built off a Raspberry Pi, but there are plenty of steps between here and there that I’ll have to get through first.\nBackground\nAs a bit of background, I have pretty bad asthma, that’s been getting worse every year do to California’s worrying trend of having terrible, multi-week forest fires every year now. “Fire season” has always been a familiar phrase here, but growing up, it was more of a threat, and less a promise. I recommend reading about how indigenous peoples in California, including Yurok, Karuk, Hupa, Miwok, Chumash tribes, have a tradition of using controlled burns that managed the fires and fostered the beautiful forests here, before California outlawed the practice because colonialism.\nAnyway, I’ve become fairly reliant on the PurpleAir website, where people can buy a fairly affordable ($230 - but this kind of thing used to cost way more) wifi-connected air quality meter that gets shared out to a map, which shares real-time air quality that often shares results that are within a couple blocks from you if a neighbor decided to buy a device. However, that’s not enough for me. I want to be able to wave around a handheld meter like a ghost hunter on TV, divining whether the air outside my apartment is safe, or whether my windows are leaking smoke. So, that’s where we’re kicking off.\nBuilding the display\nParts:\n\n16x2 LCD Display\n\nSpecifically the OSEPP-LCD-01 keypad shield.\n\n\nArduino Uno R3\n\nThis decision was based on the fact that I had a 16x2 display already lying around, and that I wanted to keep my GPIO pins free for the other parts I’m going to use for this project.\n\nNote - this display is a relatively old model, and it isn’t important to use the exact model. You may have to look up a different set of Arduino drivers from the manufacturer if you are building this project on your own.\nGetting started\nAssembly is blessedly simple, this time. The keypad/display shield is designed to fit an Arduino, so you can just insert the pins and get rolling.\n\nNow, if you plug the USB cable into your PC, you’ll see the display receive power, but it’s not going to be functional yet.\nI don’t currently have the Arduino IDE, so I grabbed it from their Downloads page\nI also grabbed the Sample Code from the OSEPP website for my display.\nI dropped the buttontest code in, and it worked with no problems!\n\nSo, that solves the generic issue of “write to the screen”, but the rest of this application is going to be written in Python, running on the Raspberry Pi to take advantage of the drivers that the lovely folks at Adafruit have written.\nTherefore, I’ll need to set the code up to allow me to communicate back and forth between the Arduino and the Python script, sending messages to be displayed, and passing button inputs from the board back to Python.\nCoding for the display\nStep 1 - Hello World\nI’ve started by modifying the buttontest script to accept input and output from Serial. Here’s the code to receive a message:\n\nSo, let’s break down what’s happening here:\n\nI’m setting up the LCD display using the LiquidCrystal drivers, and assigning it to the pins that are currently wired to the display.\nThen, I declare a buffer string for any serial messages that come in.\nNext, I’m setting up the display, opening up a Serial connection, and setting the cursor.\n\nNext, the serialEvent is set up to listen to any messages coming in over the USB connection. It resets the screen and my string buffer, and then concatenates the whole message into a string. I then iterate through the characters and write them to the display, with bonus logic to handle a newline character to write to the second row.\nNext, the Python code:\n\nNot so bad, right?\nHere we set up the serial port, targeted at the port my Arduino is using, and use the io wrapper to support sending simple strings.\nAfter that, all we have to do is write our string and flush the serial io to send our message along!\nSending messages back\nSince we have a bunch of convenient buttons already attached, I naturally want to be able to use them to send messages back to the main application.\nThe buttontest example gives us a good head start on this boilerplate, but I modified to change the logic to only send a message out on Serial when the most recent message changes. That looks a bit like this:\n\nNow we are sending data back over serial as codes ranging from 0-5.\nWe can program python to listen to these messages with this code:\n\nNow, we can press buttons on the LCD Shield, process those codes in Python, and respond by updating the screen with the code!\nSince we can also pass new line characters, I can now predictably write to all the available spaces using two 16 character strings joined by a \\n newline character.\nI’m satisfied with this functionality for now, so stay tuned for part 2 where I’ll wire up the air quality sensor!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/air-quality-display/","title":"Air Quality Meter - Step 1: the Display"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/air-quality-pi-zero-setup/":{"body":"There are a lot of guides and some top notch documentation on getting start with a Raspberry Pi.

I’ve been working there as a software engineer, building developer tools for the Internet Computer Protocol since 2021. Here are some posts and tutorials I’ve written about Internet Computer development:\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/getting-started-frontend/":{"body":"Curious about how frontend code works on the Internet Computer? Here’s what I’ve learned after two weeks on the job.\nWhat you get in the starter\nIf you’re following the Quick Start guide, you’ll get some useful instructions on how to install the dfx sdk, leading you to create a templated project using dfx new hello.\n\nHow your project looks immediately after init\nThings will largely look familiar to you if you’ve been working with frontend code for a while. You’ve got src and node_modules folders, as well as package.json and webpack.config.js config files.\nThere is also a dfx.json config file, which is worth opening up and inspecting.\n\nInside, you’ll see that the template has provided you with two “canisters”: hello and hello_assets. Their names are generated to match the name of your new project you provided during dfx new.\nThose canisters point to two directories under your src folder. One has some motoko code, and the other is JavaScript. If you’re a person, the motoko code is probably new to you, but even the JavaScript has something that looks a little odd to you.\n\nThe hello object imported from ic:canisters/hello is clearly nonstandard, but we’ll get to what it’s doing in a second.\nBuild your starter\nTo get your starter running, you’ll need to run a few commands. First, run dfx start and then open a new terminal tab or window.\nIn the new window, you need to create your on a local version of the internet computer, then compile your code.\n\nNow, you should see that you have a .dfx directory, with a bunch of new content inside. The interesting bits will be the files inside of .dfx/local/canisters, inside the hello and hello_assets directories.\n\nnew dfx folder\nYou’ll see that the canisters compile into wasm code, which is what runs on the canisters, as well as a candid type delcaration file hello.did, and JavaScript files that set up an interface for your API.\nThis code is what enables the ic:canisters/hello import that we saw earlier in our source code.\nIf you look into the webpack.config.js, you’ll see that there is a pre-filled configuration that uses Webpack’s alias feature to link your ic:canisters/hello to .dfx/local/canisters/hello/hello.js, along with its type declaration file hello.did.js.\nIf you’re looking closely at hello.js, however, you’ll notice something that’s not immediately clear. It attaches its interface to a global object, ic.agent. You can run a search on your codebase, but you’ll see that there’s nowhere that sets up this global ic object that you can access.\nStill, you can navigate to your browser, pull up localhost:8000 and pass your canister id as a query parameter, and you’ll get an html payload that loads and executes your code. The reason that the code works is that the asset canister has a few assumptions and some magic it’s doing for you.\n\nAn asset canister bootstraps your identity with html that initializes a global ic object and an anonymous identity.\nThat anonymous identity allows you to request static assets, including your JS bundle.\n\nFrom there, you have a workflow that will allow you to run a compile job and deploy a JavaScript application to the Internet Computer. You can work with any JavaScript technology that compiles with WebPack, and build your application.\nWait, I have to manually build and deploy every time? That sounds slow and bad.\nYeah, I agree with you on that one, and I think we can make some big improvements. In my next post, I’ll get into how you can use the @dfinity/agent package and a polyfill to create your own global ic object to start working with webpack-dev-server and enable a more modern workflow. We’re actively working on making this process friendlier internally, but if you’re eager to get started, you can check out our unofficial Create React App DFX Template work in progress.

This example shows how to cache those results so your users can reap the performance benefits!\nCode for this example lives at https://github.com/krpeacock/cache-example.\nOverview\nThese may be features you are unfamiliar with. The http_request API is how the asset canister can deliver assets over HTTPS to serve websites. The boundary node serves requests to a canister’s http_request endpoint if it’s available as a query.\nIf the request requires an update, for any number of reasons, you can return upgrade = ?true in the payload to upgrade the request. According to the IC Interface Spec:\n\nIf the canister sets upgrade = opt true in the HttpResponse reply from http_request, then the Gateway ignores all other fields of the reply. The Gateway performs an update call to http_request_update, passing the same HttpRequest record as the argument, and uses that response instead.\nThe value of the upgrade field returned from http_request_update is ignored.\n\nThis is demonstrated in the HTTP Counter example, which also shows how to accept a POST request in order to make changes to the canister state. Some reasons you may need an update for your method might include\n\nModifying state (updating a counter)\nReading data from another canister\nCertifying a response\n\nI’ll hold off on handling certified response case until [this bounty](is completed), but let’s focus on the basic case of demonstrating how the upgrade flow works.\nLifecycle of the process\nThe request comes in to the http_request field. The canister checks the cache for the full HttpRequest entry as a key. If a hit is found, it returns it. Otherwise, it returns\n\nBy returning upgrade = ?true, the rest of the information is disregarded. The request is sent back to the boundary node, which re-requests the same HttpRequest again as an update call, hitting the http_request_update method.\nFor this example, all the processing we need is to craft the body of the response as Text, based on all the information contained in the request, plus a timestamp. We add it to the cache, and then return the response.\n\nFrom then on, the cache is populated, and future requests will be able to work as queries over http. A slow request only needs to be handled once, and then all subsequent queries will be fast, much like a traditional architecture.\nNext Steps\nTo productionize a tool like this, you may want to consider some of the following strategies:\n\nConsider what your cache’s key should be\n\nIt may be simple enough to rely on the path of the URL from the HttpRequest. Headers for different browsers will frequently be different, but it depends on your application logic whether you may want to serve different payloads based on other components from the request.\n\nCache invalidation\n\nDoes data in your application change over time? You may want to add an expiration where the canister will upgrade a request and re-validate the response every hour, day, week, etc. You may want to add a manual call to invalidate all or part of your cache\n\nCertified variables\n\nIt’s currently difficult to implement certified variables in Motoko, but it will be important if you deliver the asset via icp0.io (or ic0.app for legacy canisters). If you have not implemented certification, you will have to access the assets via the .raw subdomain, and it will come with less security.\n\nAccess controls\n\nYou may want to deliver assets via http that are only available to certain users. If you are using traditional HTTP, the caller will not be available to you, so you may need to use other strategies, such as query parameters or cookie headers to determine whether that access can be delivered. You may want to provide a different version of a \"/account\" page based on whether the user is logged in, for example, and that might vary on the user making the request. A dynamic page like that might be something you want to exclude from the cache.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/http-caching/","title":"Level up your canister with a Http Cache"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/http-canisters/":{"body":"It’s been a while since I posted my first writeup on getting started on the Internet Computer. About three months, actually. Could I have written up a few more posts in that time on how I was figuring out the ins and outs of building IC web apps? Sure I could. However, I was convinced that nothing I wrote would ultimately be what I wanted to recommend to the world in general, because I could see a game-changing new technology on the horizon. Thanks to the efforts of the Dfinity Developer Experience team, that new experience is what I’m happy to announce to you today!\nMy official announcement is posted here: Dfinity Forum - it covers some of the same things I’m saying here, but is still worth a read!\nAlso check out this writeup from another SDK team member on the architecture of our solution: Technical Overview.\nAnnouncing Improved Asset Canisters\nWhen you first learn how to build a website, the building blocks all start in a pretty similar way. First, you create an index.html file, and fill it out with some content. Next, you style it by creating a styles.css file, make some nice designs, and link it in your html file. Finally, if you have some fancy functionality you’d like to add, you attach some JavaScript via an index.js file and call it a day.\nUntil now, building on the IC, we provided you with one index.html file that was pre-programmed to do a bunch of fancy things for you. It would load the page, create an anonymous identity using our cryptographically secure messaging library, and request a single bundle of JavaScript. That bundle had a 2MB limit, and could take several seconds before loading your custom content. We only supported that one file being requested, so any HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images you wanted on the page all had to be crammed into that bundle, which created many significant constraints. While it was still impressive to be able to serve web applications off a blockchain, we knew we could do better, and we wanted to bring things back to that simple pattern of requesting files that the modern web is built on.\n\nA familiar view of static assets in a VSCode editor\nWith the upgraded asset canister, we are giving engineers the freedom to use their own HTML, images, and whatever arbitrary content they want their canister to provide over standard HTTP requests.\nWe have unblocked using whatever JavaScript bundler you like, any library or framework you choose, and are no longer even assuming that you’ll want to communicate with a smart contract on the IC. An asset canister can now be as unopinionated as a hosting target as a generic Nginx or Express server.\nDeprecations\nIn order to make this possible, we had to walk back the work we were doing to set you up with an anonymous identity. This means that window.ic is going away, and in order to interface with the Internet Computer, you will need to import our code from our npm package @dfinity/agent. Agent will provide you with the tools to make requests to Internet Computer canisters, and we have another package @dfinity/authentication that will give you the tools to create a cryptographically secure identity that can be managed using the new browser Web Authentication API.\nWe provide you with the basics of how to get started with the new dfx new template. Check out the writeup for some more details about downloading and getting set up with the preview build of DFX.\nIt’s been a busy week, so that’s about all I’ll get to today, but soon I’ll follow up with my revised guide on getting started doing frontend development on the IC.\nPostscript\nI almost forgot! I’m taking ownership of those NPM packages now. There are lots of improvments to look forward to, but my focus will be on improving our documentation for now.\nThe new docs are hosted as static websites on the IC, which I think is pretty neat.\nAgent Docs\nAuthentication Docs\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/http-canisters/","title":"Reimagining Frontend Development on the IC"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/ic-expo/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis tutorial will walk you through the process of building a React Native app for the Internet Computer using Expo and Internet Identity. It has been a while coming, due to the fact that @dfinity/agent has been using webassembly modules for verifying BLS signatures, but we now have a solution that works with React Native.\n\nNote: this depends on a version of agent-js that has not been released as of publishing. To get started, you will need to download this zip file of the @dfinity/agent, @dfinity/bls-verify, and @noble/curves packages and install it locally in your project. Once the new version is released, you can remove this dependency and install the packages directly from npm.\n\nDownload Dependencies\nThen, you can install the dependencies in your project:\n\nGetting Started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js (version 18 or higher)\nXcode (for iOS development)\nAndroid Studio (for Android development)\n(recommended) Apple Developer Account (for iOS development)\n\nExpo Quickstart\nFirst, you can run the following command to create your app. I’ll be naming the project ic-expo, but you can name it whatever you want.\n\nThen, cd into the project. At this point, if you are set up with your preferred development environment, you can run expo run ios or expo run android to start the app in the simulator. If you are not set up, you can follow the instructions in the Expo documentation to get set up.\nInstalling Dependencies\nNext, we need to install the dependencies for our app. We will be using @dfinity/agent to interact with the Internet Computer, and there are several other necessary dependencies we’ll also need to install.\n\nSetting up Internet Identity\nWe will be using Internet Identity to authenticate users. To pull this off, we need to host a website that will process the requests from our app and return a delegation.\nI recommend simply dropping the ii_integration website into your project in src/ii_integration. This is a simple website that will handle the requests from our app and return a delegation. Add a dfx.json file to the root of your project for the ii_integration site, as well as configs for a whoami canister and internet-identity\n\nHow it works\nThe ii_integration site uses @dfinity/auth-client to integrate with Internet Identity. When the page is loaded, it looks for a redirect_uri and a pubkey in the URL parameters. If it finds these, it will authenticate with Internet Identity and then generate a deep link that will return the delegation to the app. The app will then use this delegation to authenticate calls to the Internet Computer.\nThe key tricks here are:\n1. Create the auth-client with a base key from the public key\nThe IncompleteEd25519KeyIdentity class is a workaround, since the auth-client expects a full keypair. We can get around this by creating an identity with the public key, and then passing it to the auth-client. In the future I’ll change the support in the library so the setup is simpler.\n\n2. Generate a deep link to return the delegation to the app\nOnce the user has authenticated, we can get the delegation from the auth-client and then generate a deep link that will return the delegation to the app. In this case, the identity is abstracted inside of the the ii-login-button web component, but the logic is very similar with @dfinity/auth-client.\n\nSetting up the app\nThe app itself will have a very simple structure, so I’ll gloss over that a little bit. The App renders a LoggedIn view and a LoggedOut view, and the LoggedIn view will render the WhoAmI component to display the user’s principal, while the LoggedOut view will render the Pressable component to allow the user to log in.\nThe more important logic is contained in the useAuth hook, which will handle the authentication logic. It will generate the url to redirect to the ii_integration site, and then it will handle the deep link when the delegation is returned.\n\nTODO: clean up the canister link for .env based network configs\nSetting up the agent\nFinally, once the delegation identity is ready, we need to pass a couple extra options while setting up the HttpAgent. We need to pass the identity and the host to the agent, like normal, but we will also need to provide fetchOptions, a blsVerify function, and callOptions. This will look like this:\n\nConclusion\nThat’s it! You should now have a working React Native app that can authenticate with Internet Identity and make calls to the Internet Computer.

If you are looking for how to use dfx pull, check out the DFX Pull Example.\nResources\n\nDFX Pull Docs\nDFX Pull Example\n\nDisclaimer\nThere’s probably a really clever way to automate all of this with Github releases, but I got bored while trying to prove it out. For this example, gone as far as setting up the build job for my auth client demo repo and publishing the wasm + candid, but ideally it would also handle the sha256 and dfx.json updates as well.\nThe Easy way\nFirst, you need to publish your wasm somewhere. You can create a release on Github and drag your wasm out of .dfx/local for it, or you can use a CI/CD pipeline to publish it to a registry. I’m using Github Actions to publish my wasm to the Github registry. I’m using this script - https://github.com/krpeacock/auth-client-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml. If I push a tag with a v prefix, it will publish the wasm to the Github registry and tag the release as latest.\nIf you are using this approach, and dfx, you can update dfx.json in your project to make the canister pullable. An example might look like this:\n\nSince the canister doesn’t require any dependencies, we can leave that array empty. The wasm_url is the url to the wasm file in the Github registry. The init_guide is a guide for how to initialize the canister. Since this canister doesn’t require any initialization, we can set it to null.\nDFX already adds the candid metadata for you automatically, so with the pullable configuration in place, you can now dfx pull this canister from the IC and use it in a local project.\nManaging Dependencies\nThis gets a little trickier, but is basically the same. Make sure that every dependency you want to pull is also pullable. If you do not control all the canisters in that dependency chain, you may need to create custom wasm releases with the appropriate metadata to make this possible.\nThe Hard Way\nIf you don’t want to use dfx, you can still make your canister pullable. I know you sickos are out there, so let’s get into it.\nFirm Requirements\nYour wasm must have icp:public candid:service and icp:public dfx custom sections. The icp:public candid:service section is the contents of your .did file. The icp:public dfx section is a json object with the following shape:\n\nOf these, the wasm_hash is optional. Everything else must be provided.\nHow to insert the custom sections\nI’m told you can do this in Rust somehow. I don’t know how to do that, so I’m going to recommend using ic-wasm.\nYou can install ic-wasm with cargo install ic-wasm. Once installed, you can use it to add the custom sections to your wasm.\nLet’s say you hav a whoami.wasm file, as well as your whoami.did and whoami-meta.json files. You can add the custom sections with the following commands:\n\nBreaking down what’s happening - you are telling ic-wasm to output the result to whoami.wasm, and then you are telling it to add the candid:service and dfx custom sections to the wasm. The --visibility flag tells it to make the custom section public. The --file flag tells it where to get the contents of the custom section from.\nYou can verify the custom sections were added with ic-wasm whoami.wasm metadata dfx and ic-wasm whoami.wasm metadata candid:service.\nThen, you need to publish the wasm as above, and dfx will be able to consume it.\nCustom Sections If You Have Init Arguments\nIf the canister you are publishing has init arguments, you should also provide a candid:args custom section. This is done for you with dfx automatically, but if you are doing it manually, you can use the did file as a reference. For example, if your candid includes the following:\n\nThen your candid:args would be (nat, text). You can add this custom section with the following command:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/making-a-canister-pullable/","title":"Make your Canister Pullable"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-access-control/":{"body":"Produced for Motoko Bootcamp, this guide shows a minimal example of how to add authentication to your frontend and manage updates in a Motoko canister.\nThe code for this example is available at https://github.com/krpeacock/access-control-tutorial. Here is a video I also produced for the 2023 Motoko Bootcamp:\n\nConcepts\nWhat is “Access Control”? It is a broad term that essentially amounts to “who is allowed to access or change stuff”. In cryptography, we accomplish this using cryptographic signatures\n. For the Internet Computer, we take these signatures and transform the public key into a (relatively) short format called a Principal, which looks like a series of characters, separated by a hyphen (-).\nSince the Internet Computer automatically validates the signature used to make a call before it even reaches your canister’s code, this makes it very convenient to use these Principals as a way to identify a unique user. Notably, Principals can be both a user, or another canister. We use Principals in a number of contexts - the controllers that are authorized to make changes to an application are Principals, and the caller of any method will also be represented as a Principal. Thanks to the properties of cryptographic signatures, you can be confident that a Principal cannot be faked. It will always be the same person, unless they have had their private key compromised.\nBackend Logic\nIn Motoko, there are a few tricks you can use for access control purposes. Let’s start with the creator of the canister itself.\nCreator ID\nThe simplest way you can set up your Motoko canister is to declare an actor with something like this:\n\nThis is a great place to start, but there is more information you can gather if you need it. First, you can learn the Principal that was responsible for creating the canister in the first place. If you are using dfx, you can check the Principal by labeling the actor as shared.\n\nA pattern that is common for clarity purposes is to rename the caller to \"creator\", which looks like this:\n\nThen, inside your code, you have access to both creator, which will tell you the Principal that created the canister, as well as self, which will give you the ability to reference the canister’s own Principal.\nCaller ID\nThe same pattern is available for your methods. If we take the sayHi func above, we can modify it into a “shared” query func, which will give the function access to the caller’s Principal.\n\nFrontend Logic\nIn the code sample I’ve created here, I have written a simple application that tracks the number of times that a particular caller has called the increment method.\nMost of the logic is simply about enabling this behavior, but I do want to share two useful authentication strategies that the example shows off:\nEd25519 from Seed\nSince it’s possible to generate an Ed25519KeyIdentity using a seed, this means we can use a passphrase or some other secret to generate an identity. The example does this with a password input, and enables you to have reproducible identities using a simple text input. Here’s the snippet that makes this work:\n\nInternet Identity Web Component\nThe II web component is a project I spent some time on a few months back. It takes the @dfinity/auth-client package and abstracts it with a web component that you can drop into your page with a little less configuration and some nice features. After you log in, the identity will be accessible by just checking the button’s identity attribute.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-access-control/","title":"Access Controls Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-bootcamp-authentication/":{"body":"This is an outline for a talk I have presented at ASPLOS 2022 and adapted for Motoko Bootcamp 2022. It’s not fully fleshed out, since I’ll be using it to make slides, but I figured I’d publish it anyway in case it is helpful to anyone.\nTrustless Web Applications on the Internet Computer\nThe Dfinity Foundation has launched the Internet Computer, a general compute platform which is powered by blockchain. Smart contracts run in a WebAssembly environment, and can be used to replace virtually every function possible on traditional cloud platforms.\nThese smart contracts, which we call canisters, can be thought of as stateful lambda functions. Canisters can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, and are able to respond to HTTP requests and can interact with each other though a standard, backwards-compatible interface language.\nArchitectural Overview of the Internet Computer\nMuch of this segment is borrowed from IC Whitepaper, which was written by Victor Shoup, a Principal Researcher at the Dfinity Foundation.\nWhat is the Internet Computer?\nThe Internet Computer (IC) is a platform for executing smart contracts in WebAssembly across a global network of nodes running in independent data centers. This platform was designed from the ground up to be able to scale horizontally, avoiding the scaling and bandwidth challenges presented on Ethereum-like blockchains.\nToday, close to a year since the Genesis Mainnet launch event, there are many applications running on the Internet Computer. Social media sites like DSCVR, Distrikt, NFT Marketplaces such as Entrepot.app, and more are running their services on IC canisters. That statement is perhaps understated - to be clear, every aspect of those applications is running on a blockchain platform. This includes:\n\nFrontend Assets\n\nHTML, JS, and CSS, and often images\n\n\nNo database\n\nAll user data and state is held directly in smart contracts\n\n\nAll queries and updates are direct calls to the Internet Computer\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nThe Internet Computer (IC) is a new platform for executing smart contracts. Here, we use the term “smart contract” in a very broad sense: a general-purpose, tamperproof computer program whose execution is performed autonomously on a decentralized\npublic network.\n\n\nNetwork of state machines\n\nMachines can be replicated - a replicated set is called a subnet\nFault tolerance\nStorage\n\n\nBoundary Nodes\n\nPublic API\nHttp Interface at ic0.app\n\n\nAgents\n\nMake calls to the API\nIdentity and Signatures as primitives\n\n\n\nThe IC Replica\nArchitecture\n\nChain Key Cryptography\nPeer-to-peer layer\nConsensus Layer\n\nCertified state - ingress goes through consensus\nQuery Calls vs Update Calls\n\n\n\nBoundary Nodes\n\nResolve DNS for *.ic0.app\nOffer the API gateway\nServiceworker and certified assets\n\nNetwork Nervous System\nThe Internet Computer has a governance system, called the NNS. ICP tokens that are staked into Neurons are able to cast votes on a variety of topics\n\nUpgrades to the NNS and Ledger\nUpgrades to the execution environment\nAdding new nodes and subnets\nGovernance topics and roadmap items\n\nActors and Agents\n\nActors are the encouraged model for IC canisters\n\nMay modify their own private state\nCommunicate with other Actors through messages\n\n\nAgents are designed to interact with the Interface Spec\n\nCBOR encoding\nInterpreting Candid into an appropriate interface\nMaking query and update calls to the IC API\n\n\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nCompared to traditional platforms\n\nSecurity and privacy are top concerns of users\n\nShip your software as a canister, which can be independently verified\nIdentity as a primitive - apps don’t depend on usernames or passwords\n\n\nSimplicity of architecture (stateful lambda)\n\nStable memory allows you to hold your state in memory instead of a database\nGlobal distribution and delivery are built-in\n\n\nComposability via Candid\n\nAutomatically generate interfaces for your client applications\nCanisters can make calls and interoperate\n\n\n\n\nCompared to other Crypto\n\nCheaper\nFaster\nOffers a full stack\n\n\n\nServing Certified Web Content\nWhy serve certified web content?\nIn a traditional application, you rely on the party who is providing your hosting to be a reliable and trustworthy partner.\n\nUpdates\n\nWith decentralized hosting, we don’t rely on any party being trustworthy. Our systems make it impossible to update state without going through consensus, because a malicious node could not produce the correct, matching hash of their state without having the same state as the rest of the subnetwork.\n\n\nQueries\n\nHowever, queries fetch state from a single node, optimizing for performance\nYou can always query data via consensus, but to balance the security considerations with performance, we have designed a system to allow fast (&lt;100ms) queries of certified variables / assets\n\n\n\nCertified Variables\nCertified variables allow a user to query some value, and get back that value, along with a certificate, aka a proof that the subnet has agreed on the value. The certificate can be computed ahead of time\nProcess:\n\nvalues are gathered into a labeled state tree\nreplicas sign a hash and exchange shares until consensus is reached\nThe certificate is passed by a header, along with a pruned representation of the tree\nThe certificate can be validated by the agent, and we have utilities for this in agent-js and agent-rs.\n\nCertified Assets\nThis starts with essentially the same setup as certified variables\n\nBoundary nodes proxy http requests for assets to canisters with a http_request method\nWebsites loaded by the boundary nodes deliver a serviceworker hosted at *.ic0.app\nSubsequent requests for assets can use normal HTTP GET requests, through the serviceworker.\nThe serviceworker validates the certificate headers for all assets\n\n\nLimitation - this architecture makes it hard to stream large content\n\n\nAnonymous Authentication with Internet Identity\nNow that the basic stack is explained, let’s explore how smart contracts can be used to provide secure authentication across your devices, without requiring email, passwords, phone numbers, or time-based authentication codes.\n\nAn identity is created and stored on the canister, with a list of authenticated devices\nDevices are added via the frontend at identity.ic0.app using the browser WebAuthentication API\n\nBiometrics\nSecurity Keys\n\n\nDelegation Identities are created upon request\n\nSecret key is internal to the canister and never revealed\nIdentities resolve to a Principal - our ecosystem’s friendly public key format\nDelegations expire after a configurable amount of time - max 8 days\n\n\n\nUsing an identity\n\npassed along in request from agent\nprincipal can be used to represent a user\ncan be used to authenticate requests\n\nAccess Control Strategies\n\nDirect principal-to-user mapping\n\nSimplest to get running\n\n\nAssociation of multiple principals to same user (Plug + II, fallbacks)\nDelegation Identities\nMost complicated to set up\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-bootcamp-authentication/","title":"Outline: Frontend Architecture and Authentication"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-cheat-sheet/":{"body":"I’m making this for my own reference, but I hope it helps you out as well!\nLanguage Features\nVariables\n\nConditionals\n\nAssignment\n\nLoops\n\nVariants\n\nImports\n\nManagement Canister\n\n\nFor Vessel dependencies, see Vessel\nData Structures\nArray\n\nIter\n\nBuffer\n\nTrie\nTrieMap\nHashMap\nVessel\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-cheat-sheet/","title":"Motoko Cheat Sheet"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-unit-testing/":{"body":"import { TwitterTweetEmbed } from ‘react-twitter-embed’;\nIt’s been a while since I last wrote a blog post - I’ve been busy growing the SDK team and working on my new Invoice Canister project. The project ends up scaling to be pretty complex, since I want it to be able to abstract every token ledger on the IC with a single API, and so it led to a larger Motoko codebase than I’ve written before. As a result, that led me to want a better pattern for testing my code.\nCredit where it’s due\nAfter tweeting about my frustrations finding a viable testing pattern, Paul Young tweeted about a old testing framework he came up with that has since been removed from the Motoko Base Library.\n&lt;TwitterTweetEmbed tweetId={“1484700207342239745”} /&gt;\nPaul linked to a small library called ActorSpec, which is designed to execute batches of tests, grouped by describe and it blocks, which feels fairly similar to Jest syntax.\nSetting it up\nTo get started, you’ll need to install following the directions at https://github.com/dfinity/vessel.\nConfiguring your project\nYou can find reference code for this next step at https://github.com/krpeacock/motoko-unit-tests. There, you will find examples of a makefile, the vessel.dhall and package-set.dhall files that you will need to get your test suite running.\n\n\n\nWith those files in the root of your project, you can now run vessel install, and then you should be good to go with writing your tests.\nWriting tests\nIn my case, I have added a Test.mo file that contains my full suite of unit tests. By moving the core logic out of main.mo into the Utils.mo file, I can use consistent arguments in a Types.mo file for my canister’s methods, and then test all the functional logic directly out of Utils.mo.\nWith that, I can use a nice syntax of describe function calls that pass do {} blocks that evaluate to true or false. We can then test the functions with various inputs against their expected outputs in under a second (depending on the extent of the functionality).\n\nSome limitations\nThe main limits here are that unit tests will not interact with core replica features. Here is some functionality you will not be able to handle with unit tests in the current state:\n\nTime\nCalls for randomness\nInter-canister calls\nManaging state\nUpgrade hooks\n\nFor this sort of functionality, I recommend writing end-to-end tests, deploying to alternate “staging” canisters before production, and automating your deployment scripts for consistency.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-unit-testing/","title":"Unit Testing in Motoko"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-using-variants/":{"body":"Motoko variants are a cool language feature that lets you tag data with a custom label. In the base form, the label is the entire information that you are storing, similar to an enum. For example,\n\nAs you can see, our variable name is of type Name, which is a variant with a single tag #tag. We can also add a Type to the tag, which looks like this:\n\nThe tag is separated from the typed value with a simple space. This is not useful yet in this format, since we only are using a single variant. However, this can be expanded to include multiple tags, like this:\n\nNow we are able to differentiate cats and dogs in the same type. This is useful for storing data that can be one of multiple types. For example, if we wanted to store a list of pets, we could do this:\n\nThis can also be a way to store mixed types. Text is a useful shorthand, but you could also tag your variants as #text \"Some text\", #nat 0, #int 0, #bool true, etc.\nUsing Variants in Functions\nTo iterate through your list and make choices depending on the variant, you can use a switch statement. Here’s an example using an array of data that are either Text or Nat types, and returning all the Text values:\n\nBy using the switch statement on the item, we can set our cases to cover all of the variant tags in our TextOrNat type. We handle the tag and then specify a variable name to use for the value. In this case, we are only interested in the #text tag, so we add the value to our textBuf buffer. If we wanted to handle the #nat tag, we could add a case for that as well.\nYou can see this little example on the Motoko playground at https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/?tag=2689482111\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-using-variants/","title":"Using Motoko Variants"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/simple-canister-e2e/":{"body":"Have you gotten started building on the Internet Computer and are interested in writing some automated tests for your code? This is a quick guide on how to get started, using the Hello World starter app.\nAn example project with all the code used here is available at https://github.com/krpeacock/sample-canister-e2e.\nSetting Up\nFirst, start with a dfx new hello project. Remove the hello_assets folder and then remove the canister config in dfx.json. Once you’ve cleaned up the boilerplate, your config should look like this:\n\nNext, install vitest and isomorphic-fetch. Note: You can use Jest instead, but you’ll need to do a little more setup.\n\nAdd \"test\": \"vitest\" to your package.json scripts.\nActor setup\nCreate a folder for your tests. I place mine in &lt;project-root&gt;/src/e2e. Inside of e2e, create a\nutility to create your agent using the generated declarations, named actor.js. Note: I’m mixing use of JS and TS files here because there are a couple annoying TS warnings with these imports that aren’t worth fixing.\n\n\nSince we are testing locally, we always will fetch the root key.\n\nThis setup file handles reading canister IDs from their JSON, importing IDL from the declarations, creating a default actor and configuring it with a fetch polyfill (not necessary in Node 16+) and local host.\nWriting tests\nNow, create a file for your tests. hello.test.ts. First, we’ll set up the basics, importing our testing methods, agent-js imports, and our actor utilities.\n\nCalling Hello World\nFinally, we can test our canister! This method is fundamentally pretty simple, but let’s go through the exercise anyway. The test method accepts two arguments - a test name, and a function. Inside of the test, we’ll run through some steps, and then use the expect util to check results against expected results. See vitest docs for more info.\n\nSpin up your canister, and then you can run npm test (or bun test!) to run your new test.\n\nYou should see a success message like this in your terminal, while vitest waits for new changes to your source code.\n\nTesting CanisterStatus\nFor a slightly more complex test as reference, let’s add a test for canister metadata using the new CanisterStatus API.\n\nRepeatable identities\nIt is often useful to use an identity that will remain consistent across runs of your e2e tests. Here is a script using bip39 and the industry standard “12 peacocks” test phrase.\n\nThis script will reproduce an identical Principal to the same seed phrase imported through Quill into DFX.\nYou can verify the reproducibility by adding a test for it - identity.test.ts\n\nFinally, Continuous Integration\nThis part is boring and I don’t want to explain how to configure Github in depth. If you want to add checks to your PR’s, do the following.\n\nadd a CI script to your package.json scripts.\n\nWe’ll do this with\n\nThis way, it automatically sets up dfx and runs the tests a single time, reporting the results.\n\nAdd a GitHub workflow config.\n\nSpecifically, this one.

That video recording is now available here:\n\n\n\n\nIntro\nFollowing up on my recent post announcing http-powered canisters, I want to walk through what it takes to build a frontend application on the Internet Computer while taking advantage of the new features we support. If it seems simple, that’s great! We worked to make this workflow approachable to engineers who are already used to hosting static assets on Netlify, Fastly, or S3 buckets.\nFor the sake of this demo, I’ll be using Gatsby.js, the framework I use to maintain this blog.\nGetting Started\nTo begin, I run the command npm init gatsby. I’m prompted with “What would you like to call your site?”, and I’ll call this phone_book. I’ll use that name for the folder to create as well. Next I’m prompted whether I’ll be using a CMS, and I answer “No”. I’ll select styled-components from the styling system prompt as a preference, skip the other optional features, and then we’re on our way with a fresh project!\nThe Gatsby new project CLI\nThis will set me up with a simple file structure:\n\nDeploy a static site\nWe can start the project up with webpack-dev-server by running npm run develop, and we can compile the project into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets with the command npm run build.\nIn order to host the project on the Internet computer, we will need to do the following:\n\ncreate and configure a dfx.json file at the root of the project\ninstall the dfx SDK\ndeploy using the dfx deploy command\n\nCreating dfx.json\nBecause Gatsby compiles its build output into the public directory, our dfx.json file will look like this:\n\nInstalling dfx\nYou can follow quickstart guide at https://dfinity.org/developers/, or \n\nYou’ll be prompted to agree to install the latest version, and you should be good to go!\nDeploy your site\nYou will need to fund your production Canister. I recommend going to https://faucet.dfinity.org and following the directions there to get set up with a Cycles Wallet.\nAlternately, I’ve written a blog post on creating a canister using the NNS app, which you can read at https://kaipeacock.com/blog/dfinity/your-first-canister/.\nStart by running npm run build to compile your website. You can now run dfx deploy --network=ic from the same directory as your dfx.json to publish your website to the Sodium network.\n\nNote: if you used the NNS guide, you will deploy with dfx deploy --network=ic --no-wallet\n\nOnce your site deploy is finished, you can find your canister id by running dfx canister id www, and then navigating to https://{canisterId}.ic0.app.\n\nTake a breather\nCongratulations! You’ve deployed your first Internet Computer web application! There’s a very good chance that this is your first application built on blockchain technology at all, and that’s worth celebrating. You’ll see that all your assets from HTML to images are all behaving normally, as if you had pulled them directly from an old-school Nginx or PHP static server.\n\nCustomizing the application\nNow, let’s customize the code here a bit. I want to build a contact book, so let’s swap out the logic in src/pages/index.js with our new application logic.\n\nThe code's a bit long, so e.target.parentElement.click()}&gt;click to reveal\n\n\nBasically, we have a form that can allow a user to create a contact, an input to search for contacts by email address, and a component to render a saved contact.\nThere are any number of ways that we could persist this information - I might initially start by writing the data to localStorage, Firebase, or MongoDB Atlas as simple text, encoded using JSON.stringify(). Here, I’ll show how to persist that data using a smart contract on the Internet computer.\nAdding a backend\nWe’ll need to make a few changes to modify our project to add a backend canister.\n\nAdd the source code for our contract\nConfigure dfx.json for the backend canister\nConfigure Gatsby to alias our code generated by dfx\nUse the @dfinity/agent npm package to make calls to the backend with an Actor\nConnect the Actor to our application logic\n\nAdding our backend logic\nI’ll create a Motoko canister that will implement the simple logic of setting and getting information, stored in a HashMap.\n\nWithout diving too far into the details here, this code uses a stable var to persist our data across upgrades, and initializes a friendly HashMap interface, that stores data with a Text type key and a Text type value.\nWe then implement our set and get interfaces, and add preupgrade and postupgrade hooks, again to persist data across upgrades.\nI’ll save this to a new folder in my src directory, at src/backend/phone_book/Main.mo. This code is written in Motoko, a language maintained by Dfinity to specifically cater to the features of the Internet Computer. The IC supports any language tha can compile to Web Assembly, and Rust and C are other popular choices for canister development. For more information on Motoko, check out the docs.\nConfigure dfx.json\nNow, we need to configure dfx to be aware of our new canister. We’ll add a new canister object for it, and we will link it as a dependency for our frontend canister. That looks something like this:\n\nConfigure package.json\nWe can add logic to copy code declarations from the Canister’s interface, by pulling them from .dfx/local. To handle this, we will add a copy:types script to package.json, and have it run before the npm start and npm build scripts.\n\nNow, we can deploy our backend locally, and generate those types.\n\nNow, those files should be available under src/declarations/phone_book.\nConfigure Gatsby\nNext, we’ll need to update Gatsby with an alias that points to our declarations. We’ll create a gatsby-node.js file in the root of our project, and write some code that will use our settings in dfx.json to import our custom interfaces for our new backend.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll add a proxy to gatsby-config.js file, proxying localhost:8000, which is the default address for our dfx replica.\n\nFinally, wiring up @dfinity/agent\nWe’ll modify our index.js page with logic to store submissions from the form on our canister, using the email field.\nI’ll import the actor (doing this as a dynamic import to avoid initializing the HttpAgent during server-side rendering for Gatsby) from the auto-generated type generation that dfx provides us using the Candid declarations.\n\nWe’ll use our set method during handleSubmit to store the data and then clean up our contact form.\n\nand then we will use the get method to fetch contacts using the email search.\n\nAnd now, we have a fully-functioning application we can run on the Internet Computer!\n\ne.target.parentElement.click()}&gt;Click to reveal the final index.js code\n\n\nWrapping up\nNow that we’ve adapted our codebase, our project structure looks like this:\n\nWe can test the changes locally by running dfx deploy. That will build and upload our backend to the local replica. Once that completes, we’ll be able to run our frontend using npm run develop -- --port 3000 again, using all the nice development features such as hot module reloading. We’re specifying a port since Gatsby also defaults to port 8000.\nIf all goes well, you should be able to test the application locally by submitting and then retrieving a contact using the UI.\n\nView of successfully retrieving a contact\nAnd that should be it! You can try these steps yourself, download this example project from https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-vcf-gatsby, or use this guide as a reference to get started with your own projects! We can’t wait to see what you build!\n0.8.0 Changes\nUpdated Aug 16, 2021\nIn previous versions of this post, I was manually creating an actor file, and I was using a webpack alias to fetch the declarations from .dfx/local. I’ve updated node-config.js to use the new 0.8.0 declarations, which are a little simpler, but require a dynamic canister Id from the bundler, depending on whether your code is being run for local development, or pointing to the Internet Computer mainnet.\nYou should be able to clone the application and follow this guide as it is now with no trouble.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/static-site-generators/","title":"Static Site Generators on the IC"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/use-dfx-pull/":{"body":"\nDFX Pull Docs\nMaking a canister pullable\n\nBackground\nThe new DFX Pull feature allows you to pull a canister running on the Internet Computer simply using its canister ID. In practice, it will look something like this:\n\n“Pull” type canisters will share the same canister ID as they have on the Internet Computer mainnet during local development. The canister can also provide its own candid file, and a url to pull a wasm module from. Dfx can do all this automatically, as long as the canister has chosen to provide this information in its public metadata.\nHow to use DFX Pull\nMake sure you are using dfx 0.14.x or higher. You can check your version by running dfx --version, and you can upgrade to the latest release by running dfx upgrade.\nConfiguring your canister\nYou will list the canister by whatever name you want to use in your project, and then specify the canister ID. If the canister depends on other canisters, these can also be pulled automatically.\nPulling a canister\nOnce you have the canister configured, you can pull it by running two commands:\n\ndfx deps pull\ndfx deps init\ndfx deps deploy\n\nThis will create a deps folder with some metadata about the canisters, and allow you to cover any init arguments that the canister requires. With the whoami example above, no such arguments are required, so you can just run dfx deploy, and then dfx canister call whoami whoami.\n\nNote: As of 0.14.4, dfx deploy does not automatically deploy your dependencies. You should run dfx deps deploy before dfx deploy for best results.\n\nThat’s all you should need to get going!

It is the interface that allows Canisters to talk to each other and for agents to make calls to Canisters. The default workflow we currently show you in our tutorials is basically “write Motoko code and we’ll make the rest happen magically for you using dfx”. However, once you’ve strayed off the beaten path a bit, things have probably gotten more complicated. The goal of this post is to break down how to work with Candid for your application.\nWorking from a .did file\nThere are situations where you may have a Candid .did file that you want to work with, but don’t have the source code available. This could happen for a couple reasons - the service may be an existing canister, already running on the Internet Computer mainnet. Alternately, you could be working on a project where the backend is being developed separately, and you need to work on your portion of the code based on an agreed-upon .did file.\nSetting up\nTo illustrate this, I’ll create an example project.\n\nNow, inside my project, I’ll remove src/no_backend and clean up dfx.json. I’ll remove the no_backend canister, and I’ll remove the dependencies from no_backend_assets.\n\nThen, update the webpack environment variable to point to the canister you want to talk to. In this case, we’ll always be talking to production, but you can configure different options for different environments based on DFX_NETWORK as you see fit.\n\nNow, I’ll need to find a candid interface I want to interact with. For now, I’ll go with the Internet Identity canister. I can find my interface by going to ic.rocks/canisters, and selecting the NNS subnet, System tdb26.\n\nThen, after clicking on the Identity canister, I can scroll down and see the Candid interface of the Internet Identity canister. I’ll copy this file, and add it under src/identity as a new file, identity.did.\nGenerating types using DFX\n\nI’ll also create an empty identity.wasm file under src/identity. This will be important for the next step.\nWith the interface in place, I can have dfx generate declarations for the Identity canister by creating a placeholder canister.\n\nThis configuration tells dfx that there is a custom canister, with a .did file and the empty wasm, which will allow it to generate the types for you. To have dfx generate your types, run the following commands:\n\nNow, your canister should have created types for the no_backend_assets and identity canisters and copied them into your src/declarations folder. You can git commit those files, and now all that remains is to update webpack.config.js to point to the live Identity canister.\nNow, src/declarations/identity/index.js has automatically generated your types. If you are done with the canister, you can delete the code out of dfx.json and continue on with local development.\nGenerating Types using didc\nSo, that method is messy. It’s convenient, in that you don’t need to install any additional software. That said, if you are willing to install our Candid type generation tool, didc, you can have a simpler setup.\nInstalling didc\nYou can go to https://github.com/dfinity/candid/releases and install didc for your environment. didc-macos for Mac and didc-linux64 for linux. If you save it as didc, you can add it to your PATH in ~/bin, with an alias, or whatever your preference is.\nI have also written a shell script to automatically install the latest build of didc for you:\n\nIf you run this, you should have didc downloaded and saved to ~/bin/didc automatically.\nUsing didc to generate types\nIf we back up to the end of setting up, we can bypass using dfx to generate the types and just generate them ourselves.\nIn package.json, we can add three scripts:\n\nNow, running npm run generate:types will generate both an IDL interface and a set of typescript declarations, just like dfx was doing for us.\nWriting a custom index\nNext, we need to add an index file for our declarations, mimicking the one that dfx auto-generates. If you are using a different name for the canister you are talking to other than identity, replace all instances of it in your code.\n\nAnd with that, you’ve done all the magic that dfx was doing for you! Your new file imports the IDL and types and exports an identity actor as well as a createActor utility method.

You can follow along directly by cloning this example project:\n\nNext, you’ll need to get the principal from your computer by running\n\n\nFetching principal using terminal\nCopy that principal id and head back to your tab with your newly created Canister. Click the blue Change Controllers button to open up the controller management UI.\n\nEnter your principal in the empty second input, and then click Perform Controller Change. This step authorizes your dfx on your computer to deploy to your newly created Canister.\n\nAfter you accept the confirmation, copy your Canister ID. We’re going to use it now to deploy your first Canister.\nDeploy your Canister\nOpen up the example project, and open the file canister_ids.json. Replace &lt;canister-id&gt; with your Canister ID inside the quotes, and save the file.\n\nReplace {&lt;canister-id&gt;} in {canister_ids.json}\nThen, you’ll need to run\n\nto deploy an asset Canister, hosting the index.html file under /assets. This will deploy an incredibly simple static website to the Internet Computer.\nBreaking down the command, dfx is deploying the project using the config from dfx.json. We flag that the network should be IC, which is the production replica where you just created your Canister. Then, we say --no-wallet, indicating to DFX that you are deploying your Canister directly to an existing Canister using your principal.\n\nFinally, once the deployment is successful, open up a tab in your browser to &lt;canister-id&gt;.ic0.app, once agein replacing &lt;canister-id&gt; with your Canister ID.\n\nIf all goes well, congrats! You should have your new site live on the Internet Computer.\nTry making changes to index.html and re-deploying with dfx deploy --network ic --no-wallet to see your updates go out, running directly on the IC’s distributed network!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/your-first-canister/","title":"Deploying Your First Canister (NNS dapp)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/agent-js/":{"body":"This blog post is a first draft of documentation I’m working on. It covers how the JavaScript Agent works, our recommended workflows, and how to get set up with various tools and environments.\nBasics\nTo get started with JavaScript on the Internet Computer, we recommend you follow our quickstart guide in order to get set up with the basics of your development environment. This includes:\n\nDfinity’s development SDK, dfx\nNode JS (12, 14, or 16)\nA canister you want to experiment with\n\nSuggestions:\n\ndfx new starter project\nan example from dfinity/examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet Computer blockchain is accessible via an API that is available at https://ic0.app/api/v2. Smart contracts are able to define their own API’s using the Candid Interface Declaration Language (IDL), and they will respond to calls through the public API.\nThe IC supports two types of calls - queries and updates. Queries are fast and cannot change state. Updates go through consensus, and will take around 2-4 seconds to complete.\nAs a result of the latency for updates, best practices around modeling your application’s performance will have you make updates asynchronously and early. If you can make an update ahead of time and have it already “cached” in your canister’s memory, your users will have a better experience requesting that data. Similarly, if your application needs to make an update, it is best to avoid blocking interaction while your update is taking place. Use optimistic rendering wherever practical, and proceed with your application as if the call has already succeeded.\nA simple call\nTalking to the IC from your application starts with the canister interface. Let’s take a very simple one to begin with.\n\nThis is a Candid interface. It defines no new special types, and defines a service interface with a single method, greet. Greet accepts a single argument, of type text, and responds with text. Unless labeled as a query, all calls are treated as updates by default.\nIn JS, text maps to a type of string. You can see a full list of Candid types and their JS equivalents at the Candid Types reference.\nSince this interface is easily typed, we are able to automatically generate a JavaScript interface, as well as TypeScript declarations, for this application. This can be done in two ways. You can manually generate an interface using the didc tool, by going to the releases tab of the dfinity/candid repository.\nIn most cases, it is easier to configure your project to have a canister defined in dfx.json, and to generate your declarations automatically using the dfx generate command.\nFor our Hello World example, that looks like this:\n\nThen when we run dfx generate, dfx will automatically write the following to your src/declarations directory inside your project.\n\nhello.did defines your interface, as we saw above, and hello.most is used for upgrade safety. That leaves us with the three remaining files, index.js, hello.did.js, and hello.did.d.ts.\nLet’s start with the simplest, hello.did.d.ts.\nThis file will look something like this:\n\nThe _SERVICE export includes a greet method, with typings for an array of arguments and a return type. This will be typed as an ActorMethod, which will be a handler that takes arguments and returns a promise that resolves with the type specified in the declarations.\nNext, let’s look at hello.did.js.\n\nUnlike our did.d.ts declarations, this idlFactory needs to be available during runtime. The idlFactory gets loaded by an Actor interface, which is what will handle structuring the network calls according to the IC API and the provided candid spec.\nThis factory again represents a service with a greet method, and the same arguments as before. You may notice, however, that the IDL.Func has a third argument, which here is an empty array. That represents any additional annotations the function may be tagged with, which most commonly will be \"query\".\nAnd third, we have index.js, which will pull those pieces together and set up a customized actor with your smart contract’s interface. This does a few things, like using process.env variables to determine the ID of the canister, based on which deploy context you are using, but the most important aspect is in the createActor export.\n\nThis constructor first creates a HttpAgent, which is wraps the JS fetch API and uses it to encode calls through the public API. We also optionally fetch the root key of the replica, for non-mainnet deployments. Finally, we create an Actor using the automatically generated interface for the canister we will call, passing it the canisterId and the HttpAgent we have initialized.\nThis Actor instance is now set up to call all of the service methods as methods. Once this is all set up, like it is by default in the dfx new template, you can simply run dfx generate whenever you make changes to your canister API, and the full interface will automatically stay in sync in your frontend code.\nBrowser\nThe browser context is the easiest to account for. The fetch API is available, and most apps will have an easy time determining whether they need to talk to https://ic0.app or a local replica, depending on their URL.\nWhen you are building apps that run in the browser, here are some things to consider:\nPerformance\nUpdates to the IC may feel slow to your users, at around 2-4 seconds. When you are building your application, take that latency into consideration, and consider following some best practices:\n\nAvoid blocking UI interactions while you wait for the result of your update. Instead, allow users to continuing to make other updates and interactions, and inform your users of success asyncronously.\nTry to avoid making inter-canister calls. If the backend needs to talk to other canisters, the duration can add up quickly.\nUse Promise.all to make multiple calls in a batch, instead of making them one-by-one\nIf you need to fetch assets or data, you can make direct fetch calls to the raw.ic0.app endpoint for canisters\n\nNode.js\nConfiguration\nYou may need to do some additional configuration for your node.js application, using the default declarations we provide from dfx generate. This is because there are a couple features that are typically present in the browser context that may not be available in your Node.js context. Fetch is now available in Node 18, so that may not work out of the box. However, in older versions, you may need to configure fetch to be available in the global context, as well as the TextEncoder API.\nIn Node 18 - the setup is fairly simple. You need to make the following changes once you’ve generated your declarations:\n\nRename the .js files to .mjs\nComment out the last line exporting hello\nEither provide the canisterId through a process variable or import it directly\nPass the host during the createActor method\n\n\nThis will work out of the box, but you may also prefer to use a bundler to support TypeScript or other language features.\nBundlers\nWe recommend using a bundler to assemble your code for convenience and less troubleshooting. We provide a standard Webpack config, but you may also turn to Rollup, Vite, Parcel, or others. For this pattern, we recommend running a script to generate .env.development and .env.production environment variable files for your canister ids, which is a fairly standard approach for bundlers, and can be easily supported using dotenv. Here is an example script you can run to map those files:\n\nThen, you can add \"prestart\" and \"prebuild\" commands of dfx generate; node setupEnv.js. Follow documentation for your preferred bundler on how to work with environment variables.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/agent-js/","title":"Using JavaScript with the Internet Computer"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/dfx-0_7_7-changes/":{"body":"\nOverview\nType Inference Update\nChange to index file\n\nTypeScript Declaration Changes\n\n\nChanges to dfx new\n\nCopying the declarations\nWebpack dev server\n\n\nMigrating your project\n\nEnvironment variables\nMinimal Update\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe SDK team has an upcoming release candidate for dfx that you can install today by running\n\ndfx 0.7.7 will be our first promoted candidate in a while. There are some small bug fixes and updates to Motoko and Candid, but I want to explain some frontend changes that will be coming. I know that I’ll be causing some trouble, and that I won’t get it right the first time around, but I think these changes will help make developing for the IC simpler for most people, and it takes us in the direction of making more things “just work”.\nThe big ticket items are -\n\nautomatic TypeScript support and tab completion for your actors\nNicely configured Webpack dev server in dfx new\nResolving the fetchRootKey bug.\n\nThis will be the most disruptive set of changes to frontend development, but I hope that this writeup helps make sense of the decisions I’ve made, and makes the upgrade mild.\nType Inference Update\nThis is the main change I want to address. Starting with dfx 0.7.7, dfx will now provide you with generated declaration files that automatically provide you with correct typing based on your app’s candid service. In your JavaScript or Typescript application, you will simply be able to run\n\nand your IDE (tested in VSCode and JetBrains) will know your full service, with tab completion and the ability to infer return types from calls to your API.\n\nExample of IntelliSense for an asset canister’s service methods\nThese methods will allow frontend developers to interact nicely with the interface, and even know all the detail of what their return types will look like while working in the code. It’s even more powerful in TypeScript applications!\nTo make this possible, there are some changes to the codegen that we will create for you.\nChange to index file\nPreviously, under .dfx/local/canisters/&lt;canister-name&gt;, we would output a &lt;canister-name&gt;.js file. Going forward, to avoid duplicating the directory name, this file will be renamed to index.js.\nHere’s what that file will look like now, for a hello project.\n\nPreviously, we exported the IDL, a hardcoded canisterId, and then had you assemble the actor yourself. Now, we are setting you up with a createActor export and a hello export. The createActor function accepts a canisterId and options, and automatically sets you up with the idlFactory from ./hello.did.js.\nIf you have used recent versions of @dfinity/agent, you probably also noticed that we have added logic to fix the common fetchRootKey error that has been in place since Genesis. The createActor function will call agent.fetchRootKey for you during local development, but will not call it in production. This gives you the ease of not thinking about the root certificate, with the security benefits of your code only trusting a valid subnet that signs calls with the root key of the NNS, hardcoded into @dfinity/agent.\nThe return type of createActor is an ActorSubclass, linked with the _SERVICE interface from the adjacent .d.ts file. This is accomplished using JSDoc comments. Finally, at the bottom, we export a hello actor, which sets you up with an already created actor for situations where you don’t need to configure a specific identity, host, or other options to the HttpAgent.\nSpeaking of the .d.ts file..\nTypeScript Declaration Changes\n\nThe &lt;canister-name&gt;.d.ts file has been renamed to &lt;canister-name&gt;.did.d.ts.\n\nThis change was suggested on our forum. The types are in reference to the IDL interface from .did.js, so it’s correct for the type declaration file to reflect its peer instead of the index.js\nAdditionally, we have updated dfx to the latest versions of Candid and Motoko. The main thing to mention here is that the output of &lt;canister-name&gt;.did.d.ts may have changed slightly, and that the service is no longer a default export.\nChanges to dfx new\nTo accommodate these changes, we have made some changes to the dfx new project. Most of the changes are to webpack.config.js and to package.json, but I’ll go through them one-by-one.\nCopying the declarations\nThis is a pattern that I personally now recommend - committing your codegen files to your source code. It’s how we operated for the Cycles Wallet, Internet Identity, and other internal projects on an ad-hoc basis, and it turned out to be the only reliable way to support type inferenece without fragile path references in tsconfig.json.\nIn the new package.json, we provide you with a \"copy:types\" script that looks like this:\n\nThis script copies the contents of your canisters in .dfx/local/canisters and copies them to their own directories in src/declarations, ignoring the wasm module.\nFrom that point on, you’ll be able to import directly from src/declarations/&lt;canister-name&gt;, and your editor will be able to behave normally, without needing bundler aliases or unusual typescript configuration.\nThe dfx new project also has logic to sync the types whenever you run npm run build or npm start. This is the easiest workflow if you are doing fullstack work for now - build your file and the next time you start the frontend server, you’ll get the new interfaces.\n\nNote: more details about syncing in the migrating section\n\nWebpack dev server\nAt last, give you a pleasantly-configured dev server set up out of the box. npm start will start the server directly at http://localhost:8080, and you can simply open it, without needing to enter a canisterId query parameter at localhost:8000.\nChanges to your assets directory or src in the &lt;canister-name&gt;_assets directory will kick off hot-reload updates to the browser. API calls to will be proxied to localhost:8000, so you can interact with the local replica seamlessly.\nMigrating your project\nIf you have an existing project, you may need to make some adjustments when upgrading to 0.7.7+.\nAs I’ve mentioned, we are moving toward a pattern of development where the generated files no longer live in .dfx but instead will live as source code.\nEnvironment variables\nWith webpack, we are providing those environment variables by using an EnvironmentPlugin. At the top of webpack.config.js, we read from the root canister_ids.json and the one inside .dfx/local to map the canister IDs into environment variables, and then replace the process.env values in the code during development or at build time.\n\nIf it is difficult or not worthwhile for you to use the webpack config that we provide in the dfx new project, here are some things to consider:\n\nIdentifying canister ids. The output no longer hardcodes the canister ids into JavaScript, so you will need to provide that code using your own strategy. Other bundlers that allow for custom scripting should be able to re-use the webpack config logic.\nDetermining NODE_ENV. During development, the app should call agent.fetchRootKey(), but it should not fetch the root key in production. See Change to the index file.\nCopying the codegen is optional. You still have access to the .did.js and .did.d.ts files in .dfx, so you can choose to ignore the new index.js format if it is inconvenient, and continue providing your own Actor.createActor pattern as before.\nReturn types - if you do not want to use the dfx-provided files, consider using the JSDoc comments that we have come up with. If the code knows that your actor has a type of ActorSubclass&lt;_SERVICE&gt;, for your particular service, the development process is significantly enhanced in compatible editors.\n\nMinimal Update\nFinally, if you are looking to minimally modify your project, here is all you need to do, assuming you are starting from the 0.7.2 starter:\nYou can continue using a query parameter in your URL, you can access it via\n\nAnd you can modify the aliases reducer to point to the path, rather than hardcoding the old &lt;canister-name&gt;.js file\n\nThen, you can simply dfx deploy like normal and visit your working site with http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai&amp;exampleId=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai.\nHope this all helps, and feel free to reach out at https://forum.dfinity.org/ or to email me at kyle.peacock@dfinity.org if you have further questions.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/dfx-0_7_7-changes/","title":"Dfx 0.7.7 Changes"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":8,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":242,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":10,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/air-quality-display/":{"body":498,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/air-quality-pi-zero-setup/":{"body":158,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/":{"body":32,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/getting-started-frontend/":{"body":364,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/http-caching/":{"body":346,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/http-canisters/":{"body":364,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/ic-expo/":{"body":404,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/making-a-canister-pullable/":{"body":343,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-access-control/":{"body":297,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-bootcamp-authentication/":{"body":662,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-cheat-sheet/":{"body":30,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-unit-testing/":{"body":229,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/motoko-using-variants/":{"body":149,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/simple-canister-e2e/":{"body":325,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/static-site-generators/":{"body":790,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/use-dfx-pull/":{"body":161,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/working-with-candid/":{"body":388,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dfinity/your-first-canister/":{"body":320,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/agent-js/":{"body":690,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/dfinity/dfx-0_7_7-changes/":{"body":733,"title":3}},"length":23},"lang":"English"}
